This is my first project after hiatus doing things outside work. A simple request-response API created with Flask Python.

Brief:
When requesting a spesific data, just have to type the id into the url. Example /sear?id=securities_xx (xx is up from 1 to 100ish). Data is extracted from Gemini with prompt "Make me a 100 list of securities in the world)

Fun fact:
Coffee was a tradable goods
